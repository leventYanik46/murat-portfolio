    <p>Contracts define your business relationships. We draft, review, and
    negotiate agreements that are practical, enforceable, and aligned with your
    operational realities. From commercial vendors to strategic partners, we
    help you close deals confidently.</p>


    <h3>Key Services</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Master service agreements, statements of work, and change orders</li>
      <li>Software, SaaS, and technology licensing agreements</li>
      <li>Employment, contractor, and confidentiality agreements</li>
      <li>NDAs, data protection, and compliance-focused provisions</li>
      <li>Negotiation strategy and redlines to secure favorable terms</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Risk-Focused Drafting</h3>

    <p>We translate your business goals into tight language—allocating risk,
    clarifying deliverables, and locking in remedies so you have leverage when
    issues arise.</p>


    <h3>Negotiation Support</h3>

    <p>Whether we lead negotiations or support your team, we prioritize the
    terms that matter most: scope, timelines, liability, IP, data, and exit
    rights. You get clear guidance at every turn.</p>


    <h3>Operational Alignment</h3>

    <p>Contracts should be workable. We ensure obligations, service levels, and
    governance match how your teams actually operate, preventing friction after
    signature.</p>
