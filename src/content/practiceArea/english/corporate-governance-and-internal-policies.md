    <p>Our Corporate Governance & Internal Policies service supports businesses
    that want clarity in how decisions are made, documented, and implemented.
    Sound governance reduces disputes, supports investor and stakeholder
    confidence, and helps leadership navigate growth and change.</p>


    <p>We work with founders, boards, and management teams to ensure that your
    organizational documents, charters, and policies accurately reflect how the
    business is run—and how it should be run as you scale.</p>


    <h3>Governance and Policy Support</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Drafting and updating bylaws, operating agreements, and governance charters</li>
      <li>Board procedures, committee structures, and decision-making frameworks</li>
      <li>Internal policies on conflicts of interest, approvals, and delegations of authority</li>
      <li>Employee handbooks and codes of conduct aligned with applicable law</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Aligning Governance With Reality</h3>

    <p>Many businesses evolve faster than their documents. We help align your
    formal governance structure with how decisions are actually being made,
    adjusting roles, voting thresholds, and procedures to match your current
    ownership and leadership dynamics.</p>


    <p>Where needed, we also help leadership address legacy issues—such as
    unclear ownership interests, informal arrangements, or outdated governance
    terms that no longer reflect the business.</p>


    <h3>Supporting Stakeholder Confidence</h3>

    <p>Clear governance and well-drafted internal policies send a strong signal
    to investors, lenders, partners, and employees. They demonstrate that your
    company is serious about accountability, transparency, and long-term
    stability.</p>


    <p>We focus on structures and policies that are not only legally sound, but
    also practical to implement, maintain, and explain to the people who rely on
    them.</p>
