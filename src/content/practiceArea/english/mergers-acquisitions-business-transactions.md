    <p>We guide companies through complex transactions from LOI to closing.
    Whether acquiring, selling, or partnering, we structure deals that protect
    value, allocate risk, and keep timelines on track.</p>


    <h3>Key Services</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Buy- and sell-side M&A strategy and diligence</li>
      <li>Equity and asset purchase agreements</li>
      <li>Joint ventures, strategic alliances, and minority investments</li>
      <li>Transition services, employment, and retention planning</li>
      <li>Regulatory and compliance considerations</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Diligence with Purpose</h3>

    <p>We focus diligence on what moves the needle—contracts, IP, data, people,
    and compliance—surfacing the issues that impact price, indemnities, and
    closing conditions.</p>


    <h3>Negotiation and Documentation</h3>

    <p>We translate business terms into clear agreements, from purchase
    documents to ancillary assignments and transition support. Our goal: protect
    your downside while enabling a smooth handoff.</p>


    <h3>Post-Close Readiness</h3>

    <p>Integration starts before signature. We coordinate with your teams on
    communications, key contracts, and operational cutovers to reduce friction
    after closing.</p>
