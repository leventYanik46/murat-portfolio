    <p>A strong legal structure sets the stage for growth. We help founders and
    owners choose the right entity, organize governance, and document the rules
    that prevent disputes as the company scales.</p>


    <h3>Key Services</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Entity selection and jurisdiction analysis</li>
      <li>Operating agreements, bylaws, and shareholder agreements</li>
      <li>Equity splits, vesting, and capitalization planning</li>
      <li>Regulatory and licensing considerations</li>
      <li>Ongoing governance and compliance support</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Founder Alignment</h3>

    <p>We surface expectations early—roles, decision rights, capital
    contributions, and exit scenarios—so your governing documents keep the team
    aligned and resilient.</p>


    <h3>Scalable Governance</h3>

    <p>As you hire, raise capital, or expand, we adapt your structure with clear
    policies, board procedures, and compliance checklists that match your stage
    of growth.</p>


    <h3>Future-Focused Structuring</h3>

    <p>We design with the next milestone in mind, from banking and tax
    considerations to investor diligence and acquisition readiness.</p>
