## Overview

The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a second-preference employment-based visa category allowing advanced degree professionals and individuals of exceptional ability to bypass the labor certification process. Applicants can self-petition by demonstrating that their work substantially benefits the national interest of the United States.

## Key Benefits

<dl>
  <DListItem dt="Self-Petition">
    No employer sponsorship or PERM labor certification required.
  </DListItem>
  <DListItem dt="Flexibility">
    Apply directly with Form I-140 and avoid job-specific constraints.
  </DListItem>
  <DListItem dt="Accelerated Pathway">
    Potentially faster route to a green card.
  </DListItem>
</dl>

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify, you must first satisfy EB-2 requirements—either an advanced degree or exceptional ability—and then pass the three-prong Dhanasar test:

<dl>
  <DListItem dt="Advanced Degree Professionals">
    Hold a master’s, Ph.D., M.D., J.D., or equivalent foreign degree; or a bachelor’s plus five years of progressive experience.
  </DListItem>
  <DListItem dt="Exceptional Ability">
    Demonstrate at least three of:
    - Official academic record  
    - Ten years of full-time experience  
    - Professional license or certification  
    - High salary or other remuneration  
    - Membership in professional associations  
    - Recognition for achievements
  </DListItem>
</dl>

## The Dhanasar Three-Prong Test

### 1. Substantial Merit & National Importance

<dl>
  <DListItem dt="Substantial Merit">
    Show intrinsic value of your work (e.g., awards, publications, patents).
  </DListItem>
  <DListItem dt="National Importance">
    Demonstrate broader U.S. impact—addressing national issues or goals.
  </DListItem>
</dl>

### 2. Well-Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor

Provide evidence of your qualifications, past successes, and a clear, detailed plan for future work.

### 3. On Balance, Beneficial to the U.S.

Argue that waiving labor certification serves U.S. interests by highlighting unique expertise not readily available in the domestic labor market.

## Application Process

1. **Gather Supporting Documentation**  
   Academic records, employer letters, recommendation letters, evidence of national importance.  
2. **Prepare Form I-140**  
   Complete the petition with detailed descriptions and supporting exhibits.  
3. **Draft a Strong Petition Letter**  
   Address each Dhanasar criterion and cite all evidence.  
4. **File the Petition**  
   Submit Form I-140, petition letter, fees, and documents to USCIS.  
5. **Adjustment of Status or Consular Processing**  
   File Form I-485 if in the U.S., or complete consular processing abroad.  
6. **Attend Biometrics & Interview**  
   Provide fingerprints and, if required, attend an interview.  
7. **Receive Decision**  
   Upon approval, obtain permanent resident status.

## Conclusion

The EB-2 NIW offers a streamlined path to permanent residency for those whose work serves the U.S. national interest. Thorough documentation, clear demonstration of impact, and strict adherence to the Dhanasar test are keys to a successful application.
