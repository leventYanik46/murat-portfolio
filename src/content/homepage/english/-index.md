  bio:
    - Murat Yanık is a professor of public law and a co-founder of Capitol Law Partners
      PLLC. His work focuses on constitutional law, the law of political parties,
      human rights, and political science. He earned his LL.B. from Istanbul University
      (1994), completed an LL.M. in public law at Marmara University with a thesis
      on the American presidential system and its feasibility in Turkey (1997), and
      received his Ph.D. in public law from Istanbul University (2002), where his
      doctoral dissertation examined intraparty democracy.
    - Professor Yanık taught constitutional law and related subjects for more than
      two decades, including undergraduate and graduate courses on constitutional law,
      political party law, human rights, e-democracy, and the governance of the judiciary.
      He served on the faculty administration board and held leadership roles at
      Istanbul University Faculty of Law, including Head of the Department of
      Constitutional Law (2009–2014).
    - His international academic experience includes periods as a visiting scholar at
      Georgetown University Law Center (2011–2012) and Southampton Law School (2006),
      contributing a comparative and global perspective to his legal scholarship
      and practice.
    - Alongside his academic career, Professor Yanık has maintained a long-standing
      legal practice as an attorney (since 1995) and notary (since 2000), and he has
      served as an arbitrator with the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Board
      (since 2010). He has also contributed to professional and civic bodies in the
      human rights field through committee memberships and leadership roles.
    - Professor Yanık is the author of numerous books and articles, including widely
      used works on the presidential system, intraparty democracy, political parties,
      and judicial governance. His scholarship has been cited internationally, and
      his research projects and publications have received multiple awards. He has
      supervised master’s theses and doctoral dissertations and has actively organized
      major international constitutional law conferences, including one of the largest
      international constitutional conventions held in Turkey.
