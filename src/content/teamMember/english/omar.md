  name: Omar Bississo
  role: Criminal Defense Attorney
  bio:
  - Omar Bississo is the principal and founder of Bississo Law, P.C. While in law school,
    he clerked at the Maryland Office of the Public Defender in Rockville, Maryland,
    where he drafted a successful motion to suppress based on an illegal stop under
    the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. After the motion was granted, all
    the charges against the defendant were dropped, and the experience cemented his
    desire to practice criminal defense and become a courtroom practitioner.
  - Since then, Omar has been practicing regularly in Virginia and Washington, D.C.,
    representing hundreds of clients from diverse backgrounds facing charges ranging
    from minor traffic offenses to serious felonies.
  - His track record includes vigorous courtroom defense, including jury trials, as
    well as sophisticated appellate advocacy that has resulted in four published opinions
    in the Atlantic Reporter.
